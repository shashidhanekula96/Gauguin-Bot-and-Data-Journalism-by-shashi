# Gauguin-Bot-and-Data-Journalism-by-shashi
In this project our aim is to create a Python based bot which creates a different types of graphs when data is provided. The bot uses graphical image data, math and Machine learning alogorthim as inputs.
Firstly, I have used webscrapping methodlogy using Google API and integrated the selenium with that to extract thousands of graphical images from google. 
The Image dataset is created using the avilable images and feeded to pre-trained Resent 50 Convolutional Neural Network model. The trained model predicts 19 different types of graphs with an acuracy of 76%.
